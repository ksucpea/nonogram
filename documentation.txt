Nonogram by George Mills

What the program does:
Nonograms are logic puzzles, first created by Japanese graphic designer Non Ishida.
The aim of the game is to fill in boxes on a grid to create an image.
Typically the image is pixel art but it can also just be random boxes, however this game only has pixel art.
Difficulty is determined by the puzzle size, with 10x10 being the easiest and up to 45x45 being the hardest.
The boxes to fill are indicated by hints on top of the columns/the side of the rows of the grid.
Every puzzle can be completed logically without needing to guess or use hints.

How to run:
Put Nonogram folder in BasicGraphics/src folder
Run the main method in Nonogram.java

Other notes:
Press S to automatically solve the puzzles if you don't want to solve them yourself
